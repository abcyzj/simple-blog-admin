# Simple Blog Admin
Administration page for [Simple Blog](https://github.com/abcyzj/simple-blog).

## Introduction
This is the administration page for **Simple Blog**. To be honest, developing the blog and the back-end server is not very difficult, but for a front-end newbie like me it's a bit difficult to write a slightly more complicated single-page application like this. And I found it fun to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org) during development.

## Built With
[Vue](https://vuejs.org) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

[Element](https://element.eleme.io) - Element, a Vue 2.0 based component library for developers, designers and product managers
